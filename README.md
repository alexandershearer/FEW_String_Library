## Here is a library I created to help with some basic string manipulation.


#### Added a few basic functions such as capitalize(), capitalizeWords(), capitalizeHeadline(), removeExtraSpaces() (currently not working), kabobCase(), snakeCase(), camelCase(), shift(), makeHashTag(), and isEmpty(). 


#### All of these functions manipulate the string in some way related to the function title and all have very simple usage. Hopefully before long I will have them all working and available to download through NPM. I could not get the Github linked to the NPM. Confusing documentation is giving me problems understanding.
